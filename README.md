2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension's folder.

To use, load the extension, then click the extension toolbar button. Currently (2025-05-21) only works in a Google Docs page, which is what I initially created it for. It doesn't work on the Docs home page, only in a document page. Also, there's a fair chance it will break eventually, when the css for docs changes.
